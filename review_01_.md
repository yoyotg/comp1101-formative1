<u>Interest of content</u>
The homepage could give an overview of what's contained in the other webpages.

The transport page is made captivating through the use of gifs and videos so there is not much that needs to be done to improve that page.
However, having the text start on the left of the page and the media appearing in the centre looks a little off, so centering all of the text on the webpage is one potential improvement.

<u>Consistency and quality of visual presentation</u>
The website is minimalistic and easy to navigate, and the navbar animation is satisfying to use.
Some CSS could be written to add colour and format to the webpage, which would improve the overall quality.
Obviously there is more content that could be added to the webpages on all of the sites but at present the most detailed page is the transport section.

On the education page, we found that the image on this page only loaded on 1 out of the 3 devices we opended it up on, so there may be a problem with the image format.
Also, content is quite barebones as of now so more could be added to the site to elaborate on any points that are being made.

<u>Quality of written presentation</u>
There is inconsistency amongst the webpages about the quality of the written content but the transport section is good, as there is sufficient information provided along with sources used during webpage design. The education page also includes written sources, which is a good addition to the page.

<u>Validity of HTML</u>
HTML tags were used well, for example the use of the span tag for the contributor section in the html files was good.
Content could be further subdivided into div containers for use with bootstrap.
Picture tags could also be added to contain the image tags and add contribute more data about the image.
