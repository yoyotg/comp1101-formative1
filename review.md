# Interest of content
Very good information, especially on the transport page and education page. However the medical page and the index page are lacking informaion. The footer should also be sticky.
# Consistency
Excellent consistency, the only issues are within the footer with the "written by:"
# Quality of written presentation 
No spelling mistakes and good gramma. Excellent.
# Validity of HTML
There are a few issues, none of which I understand. So you're probably okay.
# Evidence of collaboration
There is evidence of collaboration, however one party commited a lot more than the other so it seems that it is just acceptable.
There is evidence that it was completeted at the last minute so not great there either.
Author information is fine.
